You can find the source code for my Gradio applications at https://huggingface.co/martinmorando.

## What are Hugging Face and Gradio?
- **[Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co)** is a platform where the ML community collaborates on models, datasets, and applications.
- **[Hugging Face Spaces](https://huggingface.co/spaces)** is the section of the platform dedicated to creating and sharing ML apps (apps that use those models).
- The interface of those web applications can be build with **[Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/)**.
