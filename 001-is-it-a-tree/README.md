# Is it a tree?

## Findings
- I can see the order of the labels using `print(learn.dls.vocab)`

## Pending questions
1) What is the default order of the labels?

2) After 3 epochs, an error_rate of 0.000000 !? Is this ok? 
Is it related only to the data I provided? What if my data is biased?

3) If I used a different category instead of "airplane" would I get different (better/worse) results? What if I used a car, or a person, or a picture of a color? Why can't it require only 1 category?
