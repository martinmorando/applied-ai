# Applied AI
## Experiments with the fastai deep learning library

### Motivations
I got fed up with listening to charlatans, so now I'm deep diving into AI. I'm currently dissecting the fastai videos, the book, and the code, and experimenting to discover the truth about deep learning, learn how to build practical solutions with it, and hopefully monetize a solution.

### Note
I set my previous version of this repository, which contained chapter summaries and raw notes from the book and video, to private after carefully reviewing the fastbook terms. I respect the work that the fastai team is publishing for free, and I also want to ensure that I do not compromise my entire portfolio repository. This new public repository will only contain exercises from the fastai book (covered by the GPL v3 license) and my own experiments.
